# PWA Icons

You need to create two PNG icon files:

- `icon-192.png` (192x192 pixels)
- `icon-512.png` (512x512 pixels)

## Quick way to create icons:

1. Open `generate-icons.html` in a web browser
2. Click the buttons to generate and download the icons
3. Save them as `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png` in this directory

## Alternative methods:

1. **Use any image editor** (Photoshop, GIMP, Canva, etc.):
   - Create a 512x512 image with a dark background (#111827)
   - Add a link emoji ðŸ”— or chain icon in the center
   - Save as `icon-512.png`
   - Resize to 192x192 and save as `icon-192.png`

2. **Use online PWA icon generators**:
   - Search for "PWA icon generator"
   - Upload any image and it will generate all sizes

3. **Use a simple solid color**:
   - Even a solid color square will work for testing
   - The important thing is having the correct dimensions

The PWA will work without icons, but they're needed for a proper "Add to Home Screen" experience.
